# Flower_Classification_using_Deep_Learning
 This project is a deep learning-based flower classification system that can recognize different types of flowers using a trained model. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained in  Jupyter Lab,  while the deployment is handled using  Flask  in  VS Code
